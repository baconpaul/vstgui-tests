Tests and experiments with vstgui akin to surge

If you can build surge on mac you can build this probably.

Just @baconpaul testbed basically

```
git clone https://github.com/baconpaul/vstgui-tests.git
cd vstgui-tests
git submodule update --init --recursive
make run
```

Mac only for now. If you want to port to another platform it's sort of designed to let you do that. PRs welcome
